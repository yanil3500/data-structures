# Data Structures
The sample code contained herein will hold a number of classic data structures implemented in Python.

**Contributors**
- `Elyanil Castro`
- `Miguel Pena`

**Singly Linked List** 
- **Implementation**: `linked_list.py`
- **Tests**: `test_linked_list.py`

**Stack**
- **Implementation**: `stack.py`
- **Tests**: `test_stack.py`

**Doubly Linked List**
- **Implementation**: `doubly_linked_list.py`
- **Tests**: `test_doubly.linked_list.py`
- `A Doubly Linked List with insertion and removal operations at both end would be useful for the deque data structure.`
    - A deque data structure is a hybrid between the stack and queue; That is, a deque supports the addition of new elements
    and the removal of existing elements at two ends, specifically, the front and the rear. In brief, this single hybrid
    linear data structure provides all of the capabilities found in stacks and queues.

**Queue**
- **Implementation**: `que_.py`
- **Tests**: `test_que_.py`
- `A Queue is a linear data structure in which the addition of elements takes place on one end and removal of elements takes place on the other.`

**Deque**
- **Implementation**: `deque.py`
- **Tests**: `test_deque.py`
- `A Deque is a Queue that works at both ends. Data can be inserted at the head or tail, and retrieved from the head or the tail.`

**Binary Heap**
- **Reference**: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_heap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_heap)
- **Implementation**: `binheap.py`
- **Tests**: `test_binheap.py`
- `A heap is a data structure that usually takes the form of a binary tree, stuffed inside of an array. A heap is sorted based on the 'heap' property that defines the order of nodes in the binary tree. Priority Queues use binary heaps as their underlying data structure:`
