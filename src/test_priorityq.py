""""Tests for our priority queue"""
import pytest

# insert(value): inserts a value into the queue. Takes an optional argument for that valueâ€™s priority, set by default to whatever your lowest priority is (i.e. 0, -99, whatever).

# pop(): removes the most important item from the queue and returns its value.

# peek(): returns the most important item without removing it from the queue

# I'm going to assume that the highest priority level is 1 
# Assume that the first item in the tuple is the value to be inserted; Assume that the second item in the tuple is that value's priority level
